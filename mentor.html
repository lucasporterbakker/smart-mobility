    <h2>Sample Mentor List</h2>

<br>

    <h3>Growth-Hacking:</h3>

    <h4>Raffaele Gaito // Author and Growth-Hacker</h4>

    <p>A growth-hacking specialist is a key mentor to have on the team; to ensure that startups are effectively testing their growth - with well-honed KPIs and lighthouse metrics - enabling them to efficiently iterate.</p>

<br>

    <h3>Pitch Coaching and Idea Communication:</h3>

    <h4>Katia Burdet // President at Toastmasters</h4>

    <p>Of course, one of the draws to an accelerator of this caliber - among many - is the potential for follow-on funding. Having a great speech coach, or two, on the mentor roster will help maximize this potential for batch companies, giving them the tools to speak with confidence, clarity, close deals, and make an impact; in addition to reflecting well on the overall program on demo day.</p>

<br>

    <h3>Technical Workflow:</h3>


    <h4>Francesco Francini // CTO at Regola S.r.l.</h4>
    <h4>Matteo Ferrabone // CTO at Waterview</h4>

    <p>It is imperative for technical teams - whether remote or in-house - to be working together efficiently. Having an experienced CTO as a mentor can help establish a functional technical workflow for companies. In this case, it should be one that has: experience with smart technology; knowledge of hardware and software; and IoT development exposure.</p>

<br>

    <h3>Community Outreach and Network:</h3>

    <h4>Chiara Bonello // Chapter Director at Startup Grind</h4>
    <h4>Paulo Russo // President at Impact Hub (Turin)</h4>

    <p>Having mentors focused on community building can help batch companies get local access outside of the direct Techstars network. Of course, they can also help founders with guidance on building communities around their products too. Mentors with a background in community, and additional experience in the automotive and smart infrastructure space is a bonus.</p>

<br>

    <h3>Domain Experience in Smart Mobility/Infrastructure/Cities:</h3>

    <h4>Davide Gomba // Managing Director at Officine Innesto</h4>
    <h4>Benedetta Arese Lucini // Founder at Oval</h4>
    <h4>Pierluigi Freni // CEO at Sherlock</h4>

    <p>A founder with domain experience in the local smart-startup ecosystem in Turin could be a multi-faceted asset. Serial entrepreneurs fitting this bill would be ideal, given the first-hand practice with building companies that combine its people, data, resources, and infrastructure to enhance the livability of a city.</p>

<br>

    <h3>Design:</h3>

    <h4>Maurizio Montalti // Managing Partner, Design and R&D</h4>
    <h4>Edoardo Benedetto // Chief Designer at Oval</h4>

    <p>An indespensible asset to have, for startups to get aesthetic feedback from leaders in this space. This will help with credibility, partnerships, fundraising, and sales.</p>

<br>

    <h3>Fundraising:</h3>

    <h4>Claudio Giuliano // Founding Partner at Innogest Capital</h4>

    <p>A fundraising mentor is essential to have, for founders about to hit the fundraising trail. They will need someone to work with as they build an investor pipeline, identify who the right investors are for their business, and begin the networking blitz.</p>

<br>

    <h3>Other Thoughts:</h3>

    <h4>Matteo Giaccone // Founder at Turn Into Coders</h4>

    <p>A partnerhship with a group like this could help create a pipeline of new talent for portfolio companies, seeking junior developers, design interns, and newly-minted project managers.</p>
