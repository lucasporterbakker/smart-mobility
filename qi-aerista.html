      <h2>Thoughts and Feedback</h2>

      <br>


      <h3>Summary:</h3>

      <p>In general, I feel that the site has too much friction. I would probably recommend starting with a short product sprint workshop with this group, to clarify the unique value proposition (UVP) and refine the language used on the site — working towards communicating the core journey in 10% of what is currently there. Having spent two hours with them on this, I would be able to work with them to implement the changes, or code a new site from scratch, in less than a week depending on feedback. Killing this friction, implementing some technical tools to monitor user engagement, and testing some new strategies will help get their sales pipeline running smoothly.</p>

      <br>


      <h3>Things that are Good:</h3>

      <p>The subscription model for ordering tea is ideal, as one of the most successful business models for software is automated recurring payments. I would, recommend merging the ‘The Tea Club’ and ‘Teas’ tabs, and offer the subscription model as a way to bring the cost down; example: scaling discounts. Some A / B testing with users might be interesting here.</p>

      <p>Having the call to action (CTA) right up front is good. I would, however, enlarge it and refine the language; example: Order Now. A hero tagline is also good, but I would consider refining it as well. At present, it repeats the CTA; examples: Smart Tea, A New Way to Brew Tea, etc.</p>

      <p>The ‘How Qi Aerista Works’ video communicates the product more effectively than the language currently used on the site. I would recommend drawing on that for inspiration. However, the video should be embedded (not take me away from their sales pipeline into YouTube).  A bonus would be meta data to switch servers depending on geography; example: Youku <> Vimeo.</p>

      <br>


      <h3>Areas to Improve:</h3>

      <p>The ‘download app’ CTA could be elsewhere, as this fragments the sales funnel.</p>

      <p>In general, the use case is unclear. It seems at first like a portal to buy a better tea-pot, but turns into a tea marketplace.</p>

      <p>Some of the images show people enjoying tea using traditional brewing methods, this detracts from the inconvenience they are trying to convey.</p>

      <p>The awards design section could be condensed from an entire section to a small strip, or have logos added to a banner image.</p>

      <p>There are five sections dedicated to ‘how it works,’ this needs to be simplified. It could be one section with a clean flow diagram, for example.</p>

      <p>When clicking-through on ‘Shop Brewer,’ I am showed a power adapter. This psychologically communicates inconvenience. I agree that adding a bonus gift can be an effective nudge, but I wouldn’t mention it before the transaction is complete.</p>

      <p>There are three different font-faces on the landing page alone, two at most would be ideal. Additionally, they could consider removing the dependency on Google Fonts - the site has Roboto and Montserrat currently - this increases the website’s loading time (in markets like China) by 10X or more.</p>

      <p>Overall, the UI needs some work.</p>

      <p>The newsletter section at the bottom could be modal instead; example drop-down: Want to get notified of great deals?</p>

      <p>I would recommend WeChat integration. I could help with this.</p>

      <p>The seven images feel like an infomercial and connote low-quality.</p>

      <p>Feedback sections can be effective for new products, but I might suggest condensing it and doing a quick fix on the UI.</p>


      <br>


      <h3>General Advice:</h3>

      <p>It’s almost as if there are two business models here, one is a recurring purchase at a lower amount (tea), and the other a one-time more expensive purchase (the brewer).</p>

      <p>I would recommend spending less space and valuable user attention-span trying to establish that there is a pain point. If users have it, they have it. Really, the product is about making a great thing even better. This could be communicated in one small section, instead of several.</p>

      <p>The landing page is a lengthy infinite scroll - I counted 15+ sections. This could be cut in half.</p>

      <p>The checkout flow feels confusing to a new user. Having detailed information is good customer service, but I might display say, 20% of that; and have an ‘expand tab’ for users who want more. This could also be a tooltip or popover. The payment pipeline should feel clean and easy, and showing all of the product specs info halfway through the payment flow makes me reconsider.</p>

      <p>Generally speaking, a core user journey should have no more than five views maximum. But with a site like this - where users don’t need search functionality (to look for a specific product among many), or to be able to browse through different products before selecting one - there should be even fewer. I would aim for three.</p>
